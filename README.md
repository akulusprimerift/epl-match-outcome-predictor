# EPL Match Outcome Predictor

A reproducible Python project for predicting English Premier League match
outcomes as away-win, draw, and home-win probabilities using only information
available before kickoff.

The repository is currently at **Phase 0: Repository Bootstrap**. It contains
the project structure and dependency setup only. No match data has been
downloaded and no data-processing, feature, or model logic has been
implemented.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11 or later
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- matplotlib

## Setup

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

On macOS or Linux:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Exact versions used for the bootstrapped environment are recorded in
`requirements.lock.txt`.

## Validate Phase 0

With the virtual environment active:

```bash
python --version
python -c "import pandas, sklearn, xgboost, matplotlib"
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
git status --short
```

See `EPL_MATCH_OUTCOME_PREDICTOR_SPEC.md` for the authoritative phased
implementation plan. Later phases must not be started without explicit
approval.
